# Computer-System

My implementation of CMU 15-213 computer system labs. (In-progress), notes I [make](https://rruiqiu.github.io/Blog/CSAPP/).

**Data lab** focused on bit level manipulation. (C)

**Bomb lab** focused on using gdb to decompile the binary bomb file to find the defuse code by examining the assembly code. (ASM)

**Attack lab** introduce code injection and return-oriented programming attacks by going further to understand buffer overflow bugs in x86-64 machine. (ASM)

**Cache lab** part A designs a cache simulator from scratch and part B optimize the matrix transpose by improving the cache misses.
